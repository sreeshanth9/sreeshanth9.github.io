      <h4>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA SCIENCE</h4>
      <p>
        Currently a 3rd year student pursuing B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Woxsen University,
        my academic journey has been complemented by hands-on experience through projects in Data Science
        and Machine Learning. I am also keenly interested in working on projects that involve Java, further
        expanding my scope and contributing innovative solutions to complex challenges. Embracing continuous
        learning, and a passion for technological advancements, I am committed to making a meaningful contribution
        to the ever-evolving field of data science.

        <h5>Pneumonia Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks</h5>
        <p>
          Utilizing a Kaggle dataset comprising chest X-rays, this project aimed to distinguish between normal and
          pneumonia-afflicted patients. Employing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), hyperparameters were
          meticulously tuned to enhance performance, ensuring accurate classification and contributing to
          advancements in medical image analysis.

      <div>
        <h5>Bankruptcy Prediction</h5>
        <p>
          Led the creation of an early warning system for bankruptcy prediction, with a focus on increased sensitivity.
          Enhanced data pre-processing, SMOTE for class imbalance, and feature selection were all implemented
          utilizing various machine learning algorithms. Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, and
          Support Vector Machine were used to analyze both full and reduced feature datasets. Successfully
          presented higher sensitivity on the reduced feature dataset, demonstrating greater early detection of
          financial crisis.
